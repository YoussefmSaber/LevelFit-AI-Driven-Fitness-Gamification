# AR-Fit: AI-Driven Fitness Gamification

## **Project Overview**
AR-Fit is an innovative fitness application that combines Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality (AR), and Gamification to provide an engaging and personalized workout experience. The app helps users achieve their fitness goals by offering tailored workout plans, interactive AR guides, and rewards for maintaining streaks and completing challenges.

## **Features**

### **Phase 1: Core Features (MVP)**
- **User Registration & Profile**
  - User authentication with email/password using Firebase.
  - User profile setup to input age, weight, and fitness goals.

- **Workout Plans**
  - Predefined workout routines (e.g., cardio, strength) stored locally using Room database.
  - Easy-to-navigate UI to display available workout plans.

- **Progress Tracking**
  - Visualize user progress using charts (e.g., bar, pie) via Jetpack Compose Canvas or libraries like MPAndroidChart.
  - Daily streak counter for completed workouts.

### **Phase 2: Gamification**
- **Reward System**
  - Points for completing workouts or maintaining streaks.
  - Badges for milestones (e.g., "7-Day Streak").

- **Challenges**
  - Fitness challenges like "Complete 5 Workouts This Week" with progress tracking.

### **Phase 3: Augmented Reality (AR)**
- **AR Workout Guide**
  - Interactive AR overlays to visualize exercises (e.g., squats, push-ups) using Google ARCore.
  - AR visualizations of workout zones, creating a virtual gym environment.

### **Phase 4: AI Integration**
- **Personalized Recommendations**
  - AI-powered suggestions for workouts based on user progress and history.
  - Rest day and recovery recommendations using ML Kit or TensorFlow Lite.

### **Phase 5: Blockchain Integration (Optional)**
- **Blockchain-Based Rewards**
  - Tokens as rewards for completing challenges, redeemable for in-app features or real-world benefits.
  - Collectible achievement NFTs for milestones.
